# VirtualMemory_Manager
Implementação do Designing a Virtual Memory Manager projeto da matéria de Infraestrutura de Software, do terceiro período de Ciência da Computação na Cesar School.

### Designing a Virtual Memory Manager
This project consists of writing a program that translates logical to physical addresses for a virtual address space of size 2^16 =  65,536 bytes. Your program will read from a file containing logical  addresses and, using a TLB as well as a page table, will translate each logical address to its corresponding physical address and output the value of the byte stored at the translated physical address.
